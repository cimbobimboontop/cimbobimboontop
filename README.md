# 👋 Hi, I'm Matúš Krivánik





I'm a 16-year-old student from Slovakia, passionate about computers at the lowest level — from logic gates and registers to kernels and compilers.

## 🛠️ What I'm working on





- 🧠 Designing an **8-bit CPU** from scratch in Logisim Evolution


- 💻 Learning **x86-64 Assembly**, **C++**, **C**,and **Python**


- 🧬 Planning a custom **instruction set**, assembler, and emulator


- 📦 Experimenting with **Linux servers**, networking, and homelab setups


- 📚 Studying OS internals, bootloaders, and CPU architecture





---





## 🌱 My Goals





- Understand how computers truly work at the hardware and OS level  


- Build a working CPU → write a compiler → boot an OS on real metal  


- Get into a top CS program (MIT, ETH Zürich, Waterloo, etc.)
