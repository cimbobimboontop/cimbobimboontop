👋 Hi, I'm Matúš Krivánik

I'm a 16-year-old student from Slovakia, passionate about computers at the lowest level — from logic gates and registers to kernels and compilers.  
Lately, I've also started exploring full-stack **web development** to round out my skills.

🛠️ What I'm working on

- 🧠 Designing an 8-bit CPU from scratch in Logisim Evolution  
- 💻 Learning x86-64 Assembly, C++, Python, and now HTML/CSS + JavaScript  
- 🌐 Building basic web apps and experimenting with frontend/backend frameworks  
- 📦 Experimenting with Linux servers, networking, and homelab setups  
- 📚 Studying OS internals, bootloaders, and CPU architecture

🌱 My Goals

- Understand how computers truly work at the hardware and OS level  
- Build a working CPU → write a compiler → boot an OS on real metal  
- Become fluent in modern web technologies (React, Express, etc.)  
- Get into a top CS program (MIT, ETH Zürich, Waterloo, etc.)

🧠 Tech I love

x86-64 • C++ • Python • Linux • Logisim • Networking • Assembler • Reverse Engineering • Web Dev • Low-level debugging

📚 Inspirations

- *Code* by Charles Petzold  
- Ben Eater’s 8-bit CPU  
- nand2tetris  
- OSDev Wiki & low-level projects
